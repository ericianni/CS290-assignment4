Tasks: Setting up error checking in multtable.php. Can't figure out how to 
check to see if something is a number other than (int).

Tasks: Self admittedly spent too much time with CSS. Still unsure how to check
for integers because my input fields are set to number so won't let the user
submit without inputting a valid integer. Also intiated the git.

Tasks: Added all the files to the commit. Still need to upload it to GitHub.
Struggled a bit with the login/content1/content2 part. The lecture used a 
link with a GET key/value to end the session. I was trying how to do that with
POST and had a fourth page just to clear the session. I eventually just did it 
with a GET called on login.php itself. Still don't understand headers too much.
Needs more research.
